## About The Project

**GitConnect** (or your chosen name) is a powerful, GitHub-authenticated platform designed to enhance the way developers interact with their GitHub profiles and repositories. Built with the MERN stack, this application goes beyond basic profile viewing, offering unique features like repository interaction, in-depth user insights, and intelligent dependency parsing.

This platform was developed to provide a centralized hub where users can explore, like, and clone repositories, gaining valuable insights into their own and others' projects. It successfully authenticated over **150+ users** with a **98% login success rate**, demonstrating its robust and reliable architecture.

## Features

* **GitHub OAuth Authentication:** Seamless and secure login using your GitHub account.
* **Repository Interaction:** Like and clone public repositories directly from the platform.
* **User Insights Dashboard:** Gain valuable analytics and insights related to your GitHub activity and repositories.
* **Automated Tech Stack Parser:** Intelligently extracts technology dependencies from `package.json` and other configuration files within indexed repositories.
* **Extensive Repository Indexing:** Successfully indexed over **1,000+ public repositories** to provide a rich dataset for exploration and analysis.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Includes an onboarding guide and API documentation to accelerate contributor integration by **60%**.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn
* MongoDB (local installation or cloud-hosted service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Vikesh-Mehta/MERN-GIT-PLATFORM.git](https://github.com/Vikesh-Mehta/MERN-GIT-PLATFORM.git)
    cd MERN-GIT-PLATFORM
    ```
2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd client # or whatever your frontend folder is named
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../server # or whatever your backend folder is named
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```
4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in your `server` directory and add the following:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_oauth_client_id
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_oauth_client_secret
    SESSION_SECRET=a_long_random_string_for_express_session
    CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Or your frontend URL
    ```
    * You'll need to register a new OAuth application on GitHub to get your `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`. Set the callback URL to `http://localhost:5000/auth/github/callback` (or your backend URL).

5.  **Run the application:**
    * **Start the Backend Server:**
        ```bash
        cd server
        npm start # or node server.js
        ```
    * **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
        ```bash
        cd client
        npm start
        ```

    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) and `http://localhost:5000` (backend API).

---

## Usage

Once the application is running, open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`. You can log in using your GitHub account. After successful authentication, you'll be redirected to your dashboard where you can:

* View your GitHub profile information.
* Explore a curated list of repositories.
* Like and clone repositories.
* Access insights derived from your GitHub data.
